                    At the University of California, San Diego, I'm involved in a rigorous Economic and Business program offered jointly by a world ranked Economics Department and the newly built Rady School of Management - UC San Diego's Business School. 
                    In addition to pursing a Economics degree, I'm also pursuing a minor in Technology, Innovation, and Supply Chain Management. This interdisciplinary significantly deepens my understanding of Economic theories and contemporary business practices that are occuring in highly demanded industries such as Finance, Technology, and Healthcare. 
                    
                    The practical applications and rigorous coursework across these disciplines are advancing my analytical, critical, and problem-solving skills alongside my strategic thinking. Whether learning how to create mathematical equations to respresnt consumer demand or diving deep into business cases and the importance of aspects such as ethics and ESG (Enivornment, Social, Goverance), my time at Uc San Diego is intellectually stimulating me in the evolving landscape of business, economics, and technology.
